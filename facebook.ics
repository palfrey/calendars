DESCRIPTION:With Nigel Warburton\, Hamza Andrea
 s Tzortzis and Mark Vernon \n\nAccor
 ding to a recent poll carried out 
 by YouGov nearly half of the Briti
 sh public think that religion is h
 armful. However more than half als
 o believe in God or “something”
 .\n\nMany argue that belief in God i
 s irrational and harmful to societ
 y\, they also maintain that religio
 n fuels hatred\, bigotry and war.\n\n
 Critics on the other hand say that
  religion produces great good such
  as charities\, dealing with bereav
 ement and that is the only rationa
 l basis for morality.\n\nSo who is r
 ight? Are we better off without re
 ligion or should society have more
  of it?\n\nTo discuss this and other
  related issues join our distingui
 shed panel.\n\n------------ Speakers

SUMMARY:Beth CC cycles to Brighton - and I've sponsored her!
LOCATION:A long and windy road between Lond

 heel..."  The Breakfast Club 1985\n
 \nHello everyone\,\n\nMaybe not the be
 st idea I've ever had but I'm sign
 ed up now\, I have invested in some
  fairly serious looking cycling gl
 oves and the largest saddle availa
 ble in the UK - so in just over a 
 month I will be cycling the 60 mil
 es to Brighton.\n\nIt's for the Brit
 ish Heart Foundation and I'm hopin
 g to raise a lot more than I have 
 so far (although I am really grate
 ful for those that have sponsored 
 me to date!). \n\nSo what can I say 
 to convince you to sponsor me?  hm
 mmm.  Well my cycling buddy (Clair
 e Harbin) and I will cycle the eno
 rmous distance in shamefully sequi
 nned outfits and facepaint.  This 
 will be embarrassing and uncomfort
 able but we're doing it for the ca
 use...the least you can do is thro
 w a couple of quid my way\, really 
 no pressure for large amounts.  \n\n
 If we make it back in one piece (w
 e won't be cycling home by the way
 ) then I'm sure we'll have a story
  to tell.\n\nThe BHF do some really 
 great work and it's a charity clos
 e to my heart (yawn) so any contri
 bution would be very welcome.\n\nInf
 o about BHF here:\n\nhttp://www.bhf.

 ponsor me:\n\nwww.justgiving.com/bet

 the next pub in 2 minutes and cont
 inue.\n\nMy variation is a little mo
 re sedate. Aslo\, things have chang
 ed over the years around Wimbledon
  Village: the Green Man has shuffl
 ed off this mortal coil\, the King 
 of Denmark has been dethroned and 
 drinking clubs such as the Wimbled
 on Wives have long gone\, so the in
 dividual locations have been revis
 ed.\n\nThis is the schedule\, so's yo
